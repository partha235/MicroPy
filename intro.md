# MCU
In 1970s, microcontroller has been introduced to the world of electronics by two american companies Intel & Texas. The need for microcontroller evolved when there is a need for single compact designed that handel single process unless microprocessor need separate circuit for time control I/O devices and memory unit. They had become backbone for embedded system development. Microcontroller is an small integrated chip which governs the specified task within an embedded system without requiring a complex operating system. It contains processor core, RAM and EEPROM for storing programs and also peripheral devices for communication. MCU are designed for low power consumption, cost-effective and space efficiency. Modern controllers has AD converters and oscillator for time functions.
