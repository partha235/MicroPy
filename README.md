# Micropython
Its python based program for microcontroller. As like python it's also an interpreter. REPL window is available for direct interaction with microcontroller. You can check the [official page ](https://micropython.org) for more details and to download the __firmware__ for microcontroller. It was created by an Australian programmer and Physicist __Damien George__ in 2013. Micropython mainly works with the module called "__machine__". You can use software like [Thonny](https://thonny.org),uPyCraft or you can use vs code with adafruit-ampy library after flashing firmware to board.<br>
I personally recommend to use vscode with adafruit-ampy. Working with command based system instead IDE develop your skills more faster. And one major thing i Love about this module is that it allows to interact with microcontroller through terminal as like linux os. When you are in Linux OS already you can use "screen" command in terminal for REPL window as directly works with microcontroller. Refer [adafruit-ampy page](https://learn.adafruit.com/sino-bit-micropython/running-code-with-ampy) to know more about it.<br>
Fro this tutorial I'm using esp32-wroom dev-kit and raspberry pico W boards. If your new I recommend to buy esp32-S3 board alone which is very good now.
